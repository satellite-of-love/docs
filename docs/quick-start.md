This page shows you how to start building your own development
automations using Atomist.  Use this to explore, whether or not you
have access to the Atomist service, and whether or not your team has
other SDMs running.

The easiest way to get started with Atomist is to work on your laptop
in [local mode][local].  You will create your own software delivery
machine, use it, and then customize it, all in the privacy of your
machine. Later, you can connect your SDM to the Atomist service, and
then it will work with your team's version control and chat.

An Atomist SDM can run any delivery process, and many other things
besides--but for exploration we have to start somewhere.  Let's
pretend your team operates several web services, you write them in
Java using Spring Boot, and you like build them with maven.  Since
this SDM is for your personal use on your laptop, "deployment" means
starting the service up locally.

We are going to create a new SDM project, build it, run it, and then
use it: we will create a new Spring web service, make commits to it,
and see it deployed.

You'll need [Git][git], [Node.js][node] (this comes with `npm`), and
the [Java JDK][jdk] installed.  Run the listed commands in a terminal
on Mac or Linux, or in Bash on Windows (git-bash, cygwin, or turn on
bash support).

[git]: https://git-scm.com/downloads  (Install Git)
[node]: https://nodejs.org/ (Node.js)
[jdk]: http://jdk.java.net/ (Java JDK)
[local]: developer/local.md (SDM Local Mode)


## Quick start

1.  Install the Atomist command-line utility.  We will use this to
    create a new SDM project and to start it up.  Using
    [Homebrew][brew] on macOS:

        brew install atomist-cli

    On other platforms, install [Node.js][node] and then run:

        npm install -g @atomist/cli

2.  Create a local software delivery machine (SDM). This is going to
    create a new project in the Atomist projects directory (which
    defaults to `$HOME/atomist/projects`).

        atomist create sdm

    Select the default machine, `spring`.  When prompted for the name
    of the target repository, enter `quick-sdm`.  When prompted for a
    target owner, enter your user name (on GitHub or anywhere).

    The output of this command includes the newly created file directory. In that directory,

3.  Change into the newly created SDM project.

        cd $HOME/atomist/projects/<target owner>/quick-sdm

4.  Start your local SDM.

        atomist start --local

    The above command will install the project dependencies using npm,
    compile the TypeScript, and start your SDM.  Depending on your
    network connection, this may take a minute or more.

    Leave this terminal window open. Logs will print to this screen.


6.  In another terminal, check what your SDM can do. This will print a list of commands supported by your running quick-sdm.

5.  Start up the SDM feed so you can see what the
    SDM is doing.

        atomist feed

    Leave this terminal window open. Messages will print here.

6.  Now it is time to use your SDM. While it is running, the atomist command line utility can send your commands to it.

    In another terminal, create a [Spring Boot][spring-boot] project.

        atomist create spring

    This command will connect to your locally running SDM and use its
    capabilities to create a new Spring Boot project for you.  When
    prompted for the target repository, enter `quick-spring`.  When
    prompted for group identifier and root package, enter `com.me` and
    `com.me.spring`, respectively. (These are maven concepts.)  When
    prompted for the target owner, enter your user name again.

    If you look in the terminal with the Atomist feed, you will see
    the SDM cloning the seed repository, cloning it locally, building
    it, and deploying it locally.  The first time you run this, it may
    take a few minutes as it downloads all the Maven and project
    dependencies.

    You can go to the URL provided for the local deployment and verify
    that your new Spring Boot application is running.

7.  Move into your newly created Spring Boot project.

        cd ~/atomist/<your user name>/quick-spring

8.  Change the message in your Spring Boot application.  Edit
    `src/main/java/com/me/spring/QuickSpringController.java`, changing
    "world" to your location.  Then commit your change.

        git add src/main/java/com/me/spring/QuickSpringController.java
        git commit -m 'Update location'

9.  Go back to the Atomist feed to observe your locally running SDM
    noticing your commit and respond by building and deploying your
    latest version.

    Go to the URL again and verify the message contains your location.
