In an [SDM][], a command is an action that can be triggered on demand, either from the command line in [local mode]
or from chat in [team mode]. This can be any action that you write in a TypeScript function.

What would you like your team to do more frequently or more consistently?

This page will show you how to:

*  create a command
*  test your command
*  respond to the person who invoked the command
*  wrap a shell script in a command
*  define parameters for your command

This page starts after you have [created][create] a Software Delivery Machine (SDM).
